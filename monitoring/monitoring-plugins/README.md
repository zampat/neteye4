# Community collection of monitoring plugins

This folder provides a selection of plugins used for monitoring with NetEye. Generally those Plugins are compatible for NetEye 4, but most should work for NetEye 3, too. Additional hint notes should advice you.

When cloning this repository to your NetEye 4 environment and running the "run_setup.sh" many plugins are installed automatically in the Icinga2 PluginsContribDir to be used with minimum effort with NetEye 4.

Update policy role for these plugins: Here you should find Plugins from other authors of the Open-Source community. Plugins maintaind within third-party repositories should be generally maintained there and forked to NetEye repo. Pull requests to those third-party repositories help to maintain the code, contribute the community and finally help each other.

Happy monitoring !
